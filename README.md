## OOP-Java-Projects
A curated collection of Java projects built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

## About the Repo
This repository contains hands-on Java OOP projects to help learners and developers strengthen their understanding of core object-oriented concepts through practical implementation. Each project is fully structured, commented, and demonstrates clean OOP architecture.
