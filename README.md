##OOP-Java-Projects
A curated collection of Java projects built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

📌## About the Repo
This repository contains hands-on Java OOP projects to help learners and developers strengthen their understanding of core object-oriented concepts through practical implementation. Each project is fully structured, commented, and demonstrates clean OOP architecture.

## What's Inside:
🎯 Mini to mid-scale projects based on real-world scenarios

🧩 Strong OOP structure in every project (Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism, etc.)

💬 Well-commented code for easy understanding

🎨 GUI-based implementations using Java Swing
